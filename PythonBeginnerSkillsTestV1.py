# Test name: Python Skills Test for Beginners

# Test instructions:
# This test consists of 5 questions. 
# For each question, you will be given a task to perform using Python code. 
# You should write a function that completes the task as described, and then return the result. 
# You should not use any external libraries or modules to complete the tasks. 
# You should not define any global variables. 
# You may define additional helper functions if necessary.

# Test questions:

# Question 1:
# Write a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns the absolute value of the integer.
# Example: 
# input: -5
# output: 5
def absolute_value(n):
    # your code here

# Question 2:
# Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the string with the first and last characters removed.
# Example:
# input: "hello"
# output: "ell"
def remove_first_last(string):
    # your code here

# Question 3:
# Write a function that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all odd numbers in the list.
# Example:
# input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
# output: 4
def sum_odds(numbers):
    # your code here

# Question 4:
# Write a function that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a new list with all strings that have length 4 or less.
# Example:
# input: ["cat", "dog", "bird", "elephant"]
# output: ["cat", "dog"]
def filter_short_strings(strings):
    # your code here

# Question 5:
# Write a function that takes a dictionary as an argument and returns a new dictionary with all key-value pairs where the key is a string.
# Example:
# input: { "a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3, 5: "d" }
# output: { "a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3 }
def filter_string_keys(dictionary):
    # your code here
